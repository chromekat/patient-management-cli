<h1>Patient Managment CLI </h1>
</p> A lightweight CLI CRUD application that manages patient and procedure records. Was part of a term project for a Python course taken in Spring 2024. </p>

Built with Python and SQLite, the program has the following features:
- Add new patients with key biographical details (e.g., patient ID, name, address, emergency contact, etc.)
- Add procedures that are associated with existing patients and includes information such as name of procedure, date, corresponding provider, etc.
- View individual or all patient and procedure records.
- Update existing records for patients and procedures.
- Delete patient and procedure records safely with confirmation prompts
- Simple text-based UI with appropriate prompts
- Data stored via SQLite database

<strong> Use case:</strong> prototyping basic healthcare management software via the command line
